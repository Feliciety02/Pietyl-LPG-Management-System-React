## 📊 Dashboard Architecture

This system uses **one shared dashboard** that adapts dynamically based on user role.

### Why this approach?
- Consistent UI across the system
- Less duplicated code
- Easier maintenance
- Scales better as roles grow

Role behavior is controlled via configuration, not duplicated pages.

## 🧭 Sidebar Navigation

- Collapsible sidebar
- Icons only when collapsed
- Logo click toggles collapse / expand
- Centralized icon mapping
- Minimal animations (professional, non flashy)

---

## 🧾 Audit Logging

Every critical action is recorded:
- User and employee changes
- Role and permission updates
- Product and inventory actions
- Financial and operational events

Admins can review activity history for accountability.

## 📦 Product & Inventory Management

- **Admin**
  - Creates new LPG products
  - Manages suppliers
  - Controls product catalog structure

- **Inventory Manager**
  - Manages stock counts

This separation ensures control and operational efficiency.

## 💰 Financial Oversight

- Cashiers handle transactions
- Accountants manage remittances and reports
- Admins view high level financial summaries

Clear separation between **execution** and **oversight**.
